### ChatBuddy – A Simple Chatbot in Python ###

***About the Project***
ChatBuddy is a mini rule-based **GUI chatbot** built using Python, NLTK, and Tkinter. It can recognize greetings, questions, and small talk, and gives appropriate responses using keyword matching. It opens in a **chat-style window** and makes chatting more interactive.

***Tools and Libraries Used***
- **Python** – Main programming language
- **NLTK** – For processing user input (intent detection)
- **Tkinter** – To build the GUI interface (chat window)
- **VS Code** – Used to write and edit the code
  
***Features***
- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter
- Scrollable chat window with user and bot message bubbles
- Personalized responses with admin name and role
- Styled interface with colored messages
 
***How to Run***
1. Install NLTK if not already installed:
2. Install NLTK: ```bash pip install nltk

***How It Works***
1. Run the Python script.
2. A GUI chat window opens.
3. Type your message in the input box and hit "Send".
4. The bot checks the message, detects your intent, and replies.
5. Replies appear with colored formatting and a timestamp.

***Note*** 
- This chatbot is rule-based, so if you ask something outside of its trained responses or logic,
it will treat it as unknown talk and give a default reply.
-  It also uses emojis to make the conversation more friendly and fun!
